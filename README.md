# RemoteWindClient
The Arduino client for [RemoteWind](https://github.com/remote-wind/remote-wind).

## Explanation ##
RemoteWindClient is an Arduino sketch that reads wind speed and direction using a SparkFun [Weather Meter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942). It sends these readings to [http://blast.nu](http://blast.nu) using a SeeedStudio [GPRS Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GPRS_Shield_V3.0).

The examples below uses the IMEI 3459798234982374 which is the same as our station at Ã…re Strand.

A station posting wind data to [RemoteWind](https://github.com/remote-wind/remote-wind) first asks for its id using its IMEI number:
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/stations/find/3459798234982374"
```
The response back is a JSON with its id: ```{"id":7}```

After that the station will also reports it's current software version for easier management of devices.
```
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/stations/7/firmware_version.json" -d "station[firmware_version]=v1.1.2-21-g9c66f94&station[gsm_software]=1137B10SIM900M64_ST_PZ"
```

After that is can use this id to post new readings:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/stations/7/observations/" -d "observation[direction]=426&observation[speed]=0&observation[min_wind_speed]=0&observation[max_wind_speed]=0"
```

## Build environment setup ##
[Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous) the 1.6.4 version of the Arduino IDE.

In the libraries folder checkout the following libraries:

* [GSMGPRS_Shield](https://github.com/YellowOrb/GSMGPRS_Shield)
* [SoftwareSerial by YellowOrb](https://github.com/YellowOrb/SoftwareSerial_by_YellowOrb)
* [arduino-restclient](https://github.com/YellowOrb/arduino-restclient)
* [Time](https://github.com/YellowOrb/Time)
* [EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt)

To be able to compile you need to set the board to Duemilanove or Diecimila and processor ATmega328. And the SoftwareSerial_by_YellowOrb needs to be changed; add #define NOT_USE_PCINT0 on line 31 or similar in [SoftwareSerial_by_YO.cpp](https://github.com/YellowOrb/SoftwareSerial_by_YellowOrb/blob/master/SoftwareSerial_by_YO.cpp#L31)

Add the following git hooks to get automatic update of the version/build number, both a `post-commit` and a `pre-push`. The hooks are just executable text files so create these using you favorite editor. Both should look like this and be created in the .git/hooks folder:

```
#!/bin/sh
#
version=$(git describe --tags --long)
echo "#define VERSION \""$version"\"" > ./version.h
```
## Development hints##
###Tagging a new release###
To create a new tag use the command line ```git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"```.
After tagging make a push with the new tag included like ```git push origin v1.5```.
